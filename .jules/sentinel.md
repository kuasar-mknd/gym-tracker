## 2025-03-02 - SQL DB::raw() Usage
**Vulnerability:** Found `DB::raw()` being used directly within a standard `select()` method across services and actions (e.g., `StatsService.php`, `FetchSupplementsIndexAction.php`).
**Learning:** Even though the current usage uses static strings and is technically safe, this pattern is inherently fragile and prone to SQL injection vulnerabilities if future developers naively inject or concatenate user input into these closures.
**Prevention:** Rather than using `select(DB::raw(...))`, we should utilize `selectRaw(...)` which supports parameterized bindings and clearly separates standard select clauses from complex, raw SQL aggregates.
