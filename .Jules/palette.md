**Learning:** Decorative icons (Material Symbols) must have `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent screen readers from announcing ligature text. Interactive elements inside components (like a clear button in a `GlassInput`) should not have `tabindex="-1"` if they are meant to be keyboard-accessible, and they require explicit focus styles to be visible to keyboard users. Standardizing `aria-label` in the application's primary language (French) is crucial for a consistent UX.
**Action:** Always add `aria-hidden="true"` to `material-symbols-outlined` spans. Ensure all interactive component elements have focus states and appropriate `aria-label`.
